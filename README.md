## Project Overview

This project is a **Chain-of-Thought Visualizer** that shows how AI models "think" step by step when solving problems. Imagine you're watching someone solve a math problem - you can see their thought process, how long they spend on each step, and what types of thinking they use.

**What it does:**
- Sends questions to an AI model (Ollama with Llama3)
- Captures the AI's "thinking" process
- Analyzes and categorizes different types of thinking
- Creates beautiful charts showing the thinking timeline
- Provides a web interface for easy interaction

**Why it matters:**
- Helps understand AI reasoning patterns
- Identifies bottlenecks in AI thinking
- Provides insights into how AI solves different types of problems
- Useful for AI research and development

## What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Pain Point
When AI models generate responses, we only see the final answer. It's like asking someone a question and only hearing their conclusion without understanding their thought process. This makes it hard to:
- Trust AI decisions
- Improve AI performance
- Understand where AI gets stuck
- Debug AI reasoning errors

### Our Solution
This tool captures and visualizes the AI's internal "thinking" process, showing:
- **Time spent** on different reasoning stages
- **Types of thinking** used (analysis, planning, research, etc.)
- **Sequential flow** of thoughts
- **Bottlenecks** where AI spends most time

### Real-World Analogy
Think of it like a sports replay system:
- **Normal AI interaction**: You see the final goal, but not how it was scored
- **Our tool**: You see the slow-motion replay of every pass, every decision, every moment leading to the goal

```python
class ChainOfThoughtVisualizer:
    """
    A tool to visualize how AI models think step by step.
    Shows thinking stages, time distribution, and reasoning patterns.
    """
```

**Class definition explained:**

**What is a class?**
- A class is like a blueprint for creating objects
- Think of it like a recipe for making a cake - the recipe is the class, the actual cake is the object
- Our class contains all the instructions for analyzing AI thinking

**Why use a class?**
- Organizes related functions together
- Keeps data and methods in one place
- Makes code reusable and easier to maintain
- Allows creating multiple instances if needed

```python
def __init__(self, model="llama3:latest"):
    """
    Initialize the visualizer with a specific AI model.
    
    Args:
        model (str): Name of the Ollama model to use
    """
    self.model = model
    self.client = ollama.Client()
```

**Constructor method explained:**

**Line 1: `def __init__(self, model="llama3:latest"):`**
- **What it does**: This is the constructor - runs when we create a new visualizer
- **What `self` means**: Refers to the specific instance being created
- **What `model` parameter does**: Lets us choose which AI model to use
- **Default value**: If no model specified, uses "llama3:latest"
- **Real-world analogy**: Like setting up a new phone and choosing your carrier

**Line 2: `self.model = model`**
- **What it does**: Saves the model name in the object's memory
- **Why we need it**: So other functions can know which model to use
- **Real-world analogy**: Like writing down your phone number so you remember it

**Line 3: `self.client = ollama.Client()`**
- **What it does**: Creates a connection to the Ollama service
- **Why we need it**: This is our communication channel to the AI
- **Real-world analogy**: Like dialing a phone number and establishing a connection

```python
def get_thinking(self, query):
    """
    Get AI response with chain-of-thought reasoning.
    
    Args:
        query (str): The question to ask the AI
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (thinking_text, final_answer)
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Think step by step about this question: {query}
    
    Show your complete reasoning process. Use tags like:
    - **Analysis**: when analyzing the problem
    - **Planning**: when planning your approach  
    - **Research**: when gathering information
    - **Synthesis**: when combining ideas
    - **Evaluation**: when evaluating options
    - **Problem-solving**: when working through solutions
    
    After your thinking, provide a final answer.
    """
    
    start_time = time.time()
    response = self.client.chat(model=self.model, messages=[
        {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}
    ])
    end_time = time.time()
    
    full_response = response['message']['content']
    
    # Simple parsing: everything before "Final answer:" is thinking
    if "final answer:" in full_response.lower():
        parts = full_response.lower().split("final answer:")
        thinking = parts[0].strip()
        answer = parts[1].strip()
    else:
        thinking = full_response
        answer = "No explicit final answer provided"
    
    return thinking, answer
```

**get_thinking method explained:**

**Method signature: `def get_thinking(self, query):`**
- **What it does**: Sends a question to AI and gets back the thinking process
- **Parameters**: Takes a query (question) as input
- **Returns**: Both the thinking process and final answer

**Prompt construction:**
```python
prompt = f"""
Think step by step about this question: {query}
...
"""
```
- **What f-string does**: Inserts the actual question into the prompt template
- **Why we need instructions**: Tells the AI exactly how to structure its response
- **Tag system**: Asks AI to label different types of thinking for easy parsing

**API call:**
```python
start_time = time.time()
response = self.client.chat(model=self.model, messages=[
    {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}
])
end_time = time.time()
```
- **Timing**: Records exactly when the AI call starts and ends
- **Why timing matters**: We need to know how long the AI takes to think
- **Message format**: Ollama expects messages in this specific format
- **Role 'user'**: Indicates this is a human question (not AI response)

**Response parsing:**
```python
full_response = response['message']['content']

if "final answer:" in full_response.lower():
    parts = full_response.lower().split("final answer:")
    thinking = parts[0].strip()
    answer = parts[1].strip()
else:
    thinking = full_response
    answer = "No explicit final answer provided"
```
- **What .lower() does**: Converts to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
- **What .split() does**: Breaks text into parts at "final answer:"
- **What .strip() does**: Removes extra whitespace from beginning and end
- **Fallback logic**: If no "final answer" found, treats everything as thinking

```python
def parse_thinking(self, thinking_text):
    """
    Parse thinking text into stages with timestamps and durations.
    
    Args:
        thinking_text (str): Raw thinking text from AI
        
    Returns:
        list: List of thinking stages with metadata
    """
    stages = []
    current_time = 0
    
    # Split by sentences for basic parsing
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', thinking_text)
    sentence_duration = 0.5  # Assume 0.5 seconds per sentence
    
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if not sentence:
            continue
            
        # Classify the thinking stage
        stage_type = self.classify_stage(sentence)
        
        stage = {
            'id': i,
            'type': stage_type,
            'content': sentence,
            'start_time': current_time,
            'duration': sentence_duration,
            'end_time': current_time + sentence_duration
        }
        
        stages.append(stage)
        current_time += sentence_duration
    
    return stages
```

**parse_thinking method explained:**

**Purpose**: Breaks down the AI's thinking into individual stages with timing information

**Line by line breakdown:**

**Line 1: `stages = []`**
- **What it does**: Creates an empty list to store thinking stages
- **Why we need it**: We'll add each thinking stage to this list
- **Real-world analogy**: Like getting an empty box to put items in

**Line 2: `current_time = 0`**
- **What it does**: Sets our timer to start at 0 seconds
- **Why we need it**: We'll track how long each stage takes
- **Real-world analogy**: Like setting a stopwatch to 00:00

**Line 3: `sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', thinking_text)`**
- **What re.split does**: Breaks text into sentences using punctuation
- **What the pattern `[.!?]+` means**: Split at periods, exclamation marks, or question marks
- **Why we need this**: Each sentence represents a thinking step
- **Real-world analogy**: Like cutting a long rope into smaller pieces at specific marks

**Line 4: `sentence_duration = 0.5`**
- **What it does**: Assumes each sentence takes 0.5 seconds to "think"
- **Why this assumption**: We need to estimate timing for visualization
- **Real-world analogy**: Like assuming each step takes 2 seconds when walking

**The for loop:**
```python
for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
    sentence = sentence.strip()
    if not sentence:
        continue
```
- **What enumerate does**: Gives us both the position (i) and the sentence
- **What .strip() does**: Removes extra spaces
- **What the if statement does**: Skips empty sentences
- **Real-world analogy**: Like going through a list and numbering each item

**Stage classification:**
```python
stage_type = self.classify_stage(sentence)
```
- **What it does**: Determines what type of thinking this sentence represents
- **Why we need it**: Different types of thinking get different colors in charts
- **Real-world analogy**: Like sorting mail into different categories

**Stage data structure:**
```python
stage = {
    'id': i,
    'type': stage_type,
    'content': sentence,
    'start_time': current_time,
    'duration': sentence_duration,
    'end_time': current_time + sentence_duration
}
```
- **What a dictionary is**: A container that stores key-value pairs
- **Why we use this structure**: Organizes all information about one thinking stage
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a filing card with different labeled sections

```python
def classify_stage(self, text):
    """
    Classify what type of thinking stage this text represents.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Text to classify
        
    Returns:
        str: Type of thinking stage
    """
    text_lower = text.lower()
    
    if any(word in text_lower for word in ['analyze', 'analysis', 'examining', 'looking at']):
        return 'analysis'
    elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['plan', 'planning', 'approach', 'strategy']):
        return 'planning'
    elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['research', 'information', 'data', 'facts']):
        return 'research'
    elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['combine', 'synthesis', 'merge', 'integrate']):
        return 'synthesis'
    elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['evaluate', 'assessment', 'judge', 'compare']):
        return 'evaluation'
    elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['solve', 'solution', 'answer', 'resolve']):
        return 'problem_solving'
    else:
        return 'general'
```

**classify_stage method explained:**

**Purpose**: Determines what type of thinking a sentence represents based on keywords

**Line 1: `text_lower = text.lower()`**
- **What it does**: Converts text to lowercase for easier matching
- **Why we need it**: So "Analysis" and "analysis" are treated the same
- **Real-world analogy**: Like making sure all letters are the same size for comparison

**The if-elif chain:**
Each condition checks for specific keywords that indicate different types of thinking:

**Analysis keywords**: `['analyze', 'analysis', 'examining', 'looking at']`
- **What it means**: The AI is studying or breaking down the problem
- **Example**: "Let me analyze this question carefully"

**Planning keywords**: `['plan', 'planning', 'approach', 'strategy']`
- **What it means**: The AI is figuring out how to approach the problem
- **Example**: "My strategy will be to break this into steps"

**Research keywords**: `['research', 'information', 'data', 'facts']`
- **What it means**: The AI is gathering or recalling information
- **Example**: "Based on the data I have about this topic"

**Synthesis keywords**: `['combine', 'synthesis', 'merge', 'integrate']`
- **What it means**: The AI is putting ideas together
- **Example**: "Combining these concepts, I can see that"

**Evaluation keywords**: `['evaluate', 'assessment', 'judge', 'compare']`
- **What it means**: The AI is weighing options or judging quality
- **Example**: "Evaluating the different approaches"

**Problem-solving keywords**: `['solve', 'solution', 'answer', 'resolve']`
- **What it means**: The AI is actively working toward a solution
- **Example**: "The solution to this problem is"

**Default case**: If none of the above keywords match, it's classified as 'general'

**How the `any()` function works:**
```python
any(word in text_lower for word in ['analyze', 'analysis', 'examining', 'looking at'])
```
- **What it does**: Checks if ANY of the keywords appear in the text
- **Returns**: True if at least one keyword is found, False otherwise
- **Real-world analogy**: Like checking if any of your friends are at a party

```python
def create_visualizations(self, stages):
    """Create both interval and pie charts"""
    # Prepare data
    stage_names = [s['type'].replace('_', ' ').title() for s in stages]
    durations = [s['duration'] for s in stages]
    contents = [s['content'][:50] + '...' if len(s['content']) > 50 else s['content'] for s in stages]
    
    # Colors for stages
    colors = {
        'Analysis': '#FF6B6B', 'Planning': '#4ECDC4', 'Research': '#45B7D1',
        'Synthesis': '#FFA07A', 'Evaluation': '#98D8C8', 'Problem Solving': '#F7DC6F',
        'General': '#BDC3C7'
    }
```

**create_visualizations method - Data preparation:**

**Line 1: `stage_names = [s['type'].replace('_', ' ').title() for s in stages]`**
- **What list comprehension does**: Creates a new list by processing each item in stages
- **What .replace('_', ' ') does**: Changes underscores to spaces (problem_solving → problem solving)
- **What .title() does**: Capitalizes first letter of each word (problem solving → Problem Solving)
- **Why we need this**: For pretty display names in charts
- **Real-world analogy**: Like changing "first_name" to "First Name" on a form

**Line 2: `durations = [s['duration'] for s in stages]`**
- **What it does**: Extracts just the duration from each stage
- **Why we need this**: For the x-axis of our bar chart
- **Real-world analogy**: Like making a list of how long each song in a playlist lasts

**Line 3: `contents = [s['content'][:50] + '...' if len(s['content']) > 50 else s['content'] for s in stages]`**
- **What `[:50]` does**: Takes only the first 50 characters
- **What the conditional does**: Adds "..." if text is longer than 50 characters
- **Why we need this**: Long text would make charts unreadable
- **Real-world analogy**: Like creating a summary for each chapter in a book

**Color dictionary:**
```python
colors = {
    'Analysis': '#FF6B6B',      # Red
    'Planning': '#4ECDC4',      # Teal
    'Research': '#45B7D1',      # Blue
    'Synthesis': '#FFA07A',     # Orange
    'Evaluation': '#98D8C8',    # Green
    'Problem Solving': '#F7DC6F', # Yellow
    'General': '#BDC3C7'        # Gray
}
```
- **What hex colors are**: 6-digit codes representing colors (#FF6B6B = reddish)
- **Why we assign colors**: Each thinking type gets a unique color for visual distinction
- **Real-world analogy**: Like using different colored highlighters for different subjects

```python
# Create subplots with more space
fig = make_subplots(
    rows=1, cols=2,
    subplot_titles=('Thinking Sequence (Interval Chart)', 'Time Distribution (Pie Chart)'),
    specs=[[{"type": "bar"}, {"type": "pie"}]],
    horizontal_spacing=0.25,
    column_widths=[0.55, 0.45]
)
```

**Subplot creation explained:**

**Line 1: `fig = make_subplots(`**
- **What it does**: Creates a figure that can hold multiple charts
- **Why we need this**: We want bar chart and pie chart side by side

**Line 2: `rows=1, cols=2,`**
- **What it means**: One row, two columns (side by side layout)
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a newspaper with two columns

**Line 3: `subplot_titles=('Thinking Sequence (Interval Chart)', 'Time Distribution (Pie Chart)'),`**
- **What it does**: Sets titles for each subplot
- **Why we need titles**: Users need to understand what each chart shows

**Line 4: `specs=[[{"type": "bar"}, {"type": "pie"}]],`**
- **What it does**: Specifies that left chart is bar type, right chart is pie type
- **Why we need this**: Different chart types require different handling

**Line 5: `horizontal_spacing=0.25,`**
- **What it does**: Puts 25% space between the two charts
- **Why we need this**: Prevents charts from looking cramped

**Line 6: `column_widths=[0.55, 0.45]`**
- **What it does**: Left chart takes 55% width, right chart takes 45%
- **Why these proportions**: Bar charts need more width for labels

```python
# Interval chart - add individual traces for legend
for i, (stage_name, duration, content) in enumerate(zip(stage_names, durations, contents)):
    fig.add_trace(
        go.Bar(
            x=[duration],
            y=[i],
            orientation='h',
            text=[content],
            textposition='inside',
            marker_color=colors.get(stage_name, '#BDC3C7'),
            name=stage_name,
            hovertemplate=f'<b>{content}</b><br>Duration: {duration:.1f}s<extra></extra>',
            legendgroup=stage_name,
            showlegend=stage_name not in [trace.name for trace in fig.data if hasattr(trace, 'name')]
        ),
        row=1, col=1
    )
```

**Interval chart creation explained:**

**The for loop:**
```python
for i, (stage_name, duration, content) in enumerate(zip(stage_names, durations, contents)):
```
- **What zip() does**: Combines three lists into tuples (stage_name, duration, content)
- **What enumerate() does**: Adds a counter (i) to each tuple
- **Why we need this**: We need to plot each thinking stage as a separate bar

**Bar chart parameters:**
```python
go.Bar(
    x=[duration],           # How long the bar is
    y=[i],                 # Which row the bar is on
    orientation='h',        # Horizontal bars
    text=[content],        # Text to show on the bar
    textposition='inside', # Put text inside the bar
    marker_color=colors.get(stage_name, '#BDC3C7'),  # Color based on thinking type
    name=stage_name,       # Name for the legend
    hovertemplate=f'<b>{content}</b><br>Duration: {duration:.1f}s<extra></extra>',  # Tooltip
    legendgroup=stage_name,  # Group in legend
    showlegend=stage_name not in [trace.name for trace in fig.data if hasattr(trace, 'name')]  # Only show once in legend
)
```

**Key concepts:**
- **Horizontal orientation**: Bars go left-to-right instead of bottom-to-top
- **Individual traces**: Each bar is a separate trace so it can have its own legend entry
- **Hover template**: What shows when you hover over a bar
- **Legend deduplication**: Only show each thinking type once in the legend

```python
# Pie chart - aggregate by stage type
stage_totals = {}
for stage in stages:
    stage_type = stage['type'].replace('_', ' ').title()
    stage_totals[stage_type] = stage_totals.get(stage_type, 0) + stage['duration']

fig.add_trace(
    go.Pie(
        labels=list(stage_totals.keys()),
        values=list(stage_totals.values()),
        hole=0.3,
        marker_colors=[colors.get(label, '#BDC3C7') for label in stage_totals.keys()],
        showlegend=True,
        legendgroup="pie",
        textinfo='label+percent',
        textposition='inside'
    ),
    row=1, col=2
)
```

**Pie chart creation explained:**

**Data aggregation:**
```python
stage_totals = {}
for stage in stages:
    stage_type = stage['type'].replace('_', ' ').title()
    stage_totals[stage_type] = stage_totals.get(stage_type, 0) + stage['duration']
```
- **What it does**: Adds up total time spent on each type of thinking
- **Why we need this**: Pie chart shows proportions, not individual stages
- **How .get() works**: Returns current value or 0 if key doesn't exist
- **Real-world analogy**: Like adding up time spent on different activities in a day

**Pie chart parameters:**
```python
go.Pie(
    labels=list(stage_totals.keys()),     # Names of thinking types
    values=list(stage_totals.values()),   # Time spent on each type
    hole=0.3,                            # Makes it a donut chart (30% hole)
    marker_colors=[colors.get(label, '#BDC3C7') for label in stage_totals.keys()],  # Colors
    showlegend=True,                     # Show legend
    legendgroup="pie",                   # Group name
    textinfo='label+percent',            # Show label and percentage
    textposition='inside'                # Put text inside pie slices
)
```

**Key concepts:**
- **Donut chart**: `hole=0.3` creates a hole in the center (30% of radius)
- **Labels and values**: Must be same length lists
- **Text info**: Shows both the label name and percentage

```python
# Update layout
fig.update_layout(
    title_text="Chain-of-Thought Analysis",
    height=650,
    showlegend=True,
    margin=dict(l=60, r=120, t=80, b=60),
    legend=dict(
        orientation="v",
        yanchor="top",
        y=0.9,
        xanchor="left",
        x=1.02
    )
)

fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Duration (seconds)", row=1, col=1)
fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Thinking Sequence", row=1, col=1)

return fig
```

**Layout configuration explained:**

**Main layout:**
```python
fig.update_layout(
    title_text="Chain-of-Thought Analysis",    # Main title
    height=650,                               # Total height in pixels
    showlegend=True,                          # Show the legend
    margin=dict(l=60, r=120, t=80, b=60),    # Margins: left, right, top, bottom
    legend=dict(...)                          # Legend configuration
)
```

**Legend positioning:**
```python
legend=dict(
    orientation="v",    # Vertical legend
    yanchor="top",      # Anchor to top
    y=0.9,             # 90% down from top
    xanchor="left",     # Anchor to left
    x=1.02             # 2% to the right of the plot area
)
```
- **Why vertical**: Fits better with multiple thinking types
- **Why x=1.02**: Positions legend outside the plot area (x=1.0 is right edge)

**Axis labels:**
```python
fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Duration (seconds)", row=1, col=1)
fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Thinking Sequence", row=1, col=1)
```
- **What it does**: Adds labels to the bar chart axes
- **Why row=1, col=1**: Specifies which subplot (left chart)

    const loading = document.getElementById('loading');
    const results = document.getElementById('results');
    const error = document.getElementById('error');

    async function analyzeQuery() {
        const query = queryInput.value.trim();
        
        if (!query) {
            showError('Please enter a query');
            return;
        }

        // Hide previous results and errors
        results.style.display = 'none';
        error.style.display = 'none';
        
        // Show loading
        loading.style.display = 'block';
        analyzeBtn.disabled = true;

        try {
            const response = await fetch('/analyze', {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({ query })
            });

            const data = await response.json();

            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(data.error || 'Analysis failed');
            }

            displayResults(data);

        } catch (err) {
            showError(err.message);
        } finally {
            analyzeBtn.disabled = false;
            loading.style.display = 'none';
        }
    }

    function displayResults(data) {
        document.getElementById('thinkingText').textContent = data.thinking;
        document.getElementById('answerText').textContent = data.answer;

        const figure = JSON.parse(data.visualization);
        Plotly.newPlot('visualization', figure.data, figure.layout);

        results.style.display = 'block';
    }

    function showError(message) {
        error.textContent = message;
        error.style.display = 'block';
    }

    analyzeBtn.addEventListener('click', analyzeQuery);
    queryInput.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
        if (e.key === 'Enter') analyzeQuery();
    });
</script>
```

**JavaScript code explained:**

**DOM element references:**
```javascript
const queryInput = document.getElementById('queryInput');
const analyzeBtn = document.getElementById('analyzeBtn');
const loading = document.getElementById('loading');
const results = document.getElementById('results');
const error = document.getElementById('error');
```
- **document.getElementById()**: Finds HTML elements by their ID
- **const**: Creates unchangeable references to these elements
- **Why we need these**: To manipulate the elements (show/hide, change content)

**Main analysis function:**
```javascript
async function analyzeQuery() {
    const query = queryInput.value.trim();
    
    if (!query) {
        showError('Please enter a query');
        return;
    }
```
- **async function**: Can use await for asynchronous operations
- **queryInput.value**: Gets the text from the input field
- **.trim()**: Removes spaces from beginning and end
- **if (!query)**: Checks if field is empty
- **return**: Exits function early if no query

**UI state management:**
```javascript
// Hide previous results and errors
results.style.display = 'none';
error.style.display = 'none';

// Show loading
loading.style.display = 'block';
analyzeBtn.disabled = true;
```
- **style.display = 'none'**: Hides elements
- **style.display = 'block'**: Shows elements
- **disabled = true**: Makes button unclickable during processing

**HTTP request:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
});
```
- **fetch()**: Modern way to make HTTP requests
- **await**: Waits for the request to complete
- **method: 'POST'**: Sending data to server
- **headers**: Tells server we're sending JSON
- **JSON.stringify()**: Converts JavaScript object to JSON string

**Response handling:**
```javascript
const data = await response.json();

if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(data.error || 'Analysis failed');
}

displayResults(data);
```
- **response.json()**: Converts JSON response to JavaScript object
- **response.ok**: Checks if request was successful (status 200-299)
- **throw new Error()**: Creates an error that gets caught by try/catch
- **displayResults()**: Calls function to show the results

**Error handling:**
```javascript
} catch (err) {
    showError(err.message);
} finally {
    analyzeBtn.disabled = false;
    loading.style.display = 'none';
}
```
- **catch**: Handles any errors that occur
- **finally**: Always runs, regardless of success or failure
- **Re-enables button**: So user can try again

**Results display function:**
```javascript
function displayResults(data) {
    document.getElementById('thinkingText').textContent = data.thinking;
    document.getElementById('answerText').textContent = data.answer;

    const figure = JSON.parse(data.visualization);
    Plotly.newPlot('visualization', figure.data, figure.layout);

    results.style.display = 'block';
}
```
- **textContent**: Sets the text content of elements
- **JSON.parse()**: Converts JSON string back to JavaScript object
- **Plotly.newPlot()**: Creates the interactive chart
- **Shows results**: Makes the results section visible

**Event listeners:**
```javascript
analyzeBtn.addEventListener('click', analyzeQuery);
queryInput.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') analyzeQuery();
});
```
- **addEventListener()**: Attaches functions to events
- **'click'**: Runs when button is clicked
- **'keypress'**: Runs when a key is pressed
- **e.key === 'Enter'**: Checks if Enter key was pressed

**Flask route handlers:**

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    """Serve the main page"""
    return render_template_string(HTML_TEMPLATE)

@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
    """Process query and return analysis"""
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        query = data.get('query', '')
        
        if not query:
            return jsonify({'error': 'No query provided'}), 400
        
        # Get AI thinking and analysis
        thinking, answer = visualizer.get_thinking(query)
        stages = visualizer.parse_thinking(thinking)
        
        # Create visualization
        fig = visualizer.create_visualizations(stages)
        
        # Convert to JSON for web
        fig_json = fig.to_json()
        
        return jsonify({
            'thinking': thinking,
            'answer': answer,
            'visualization': fig_json
        })
        
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("🚀 Starting Chain-of-Thought Web Portal...")
    print("🌐 Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser")
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

**Route handlers explained:**

**Main page route:**
```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    """Serve the main page"""
    return render_template_string(HTML_TEMPLATE)
```
- **@app.route('/')**: Decorator that handles requests to the root URL
- **def index()**: Function that runs when someone visits the homepage
- **render_template_string()**: Converts our HTML template to a response

**Analysis route:**
```python
@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
```
- **@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])**: Handles POST requests to /analyze
- **methods=['POST']**: Only accepts POST requests (not GET)

**Request processing:**
```python
try:
    data = request.get_json()
    query = data.get('query', '')
    
    if not query:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No query provided'}), 400
```
- **request.get_json()**: Gets JSON data from the request body
- **data.get('query', '')**: Gets the 'query' field, defaults to empty string
- **jsonify()**: Converts Python dict to JSON response
- **400**: HTTP status code for bad request

**Core processing:**
```python
# Get AI thinking and analysis
thinking, answer = visualizer.get_thinking(query)
stages = visualizer.parse_thinking(thinking)

# Create visualization
fig = visualizer.create_visualizations(stages)

# Convert to JSON for web
fig_json = fig.to_json()
```
- **visualizer.get_thinking()**: Calls our AI to get thinking process
- **visualizer.parse_thinking()**: Analyzes the thinking text
- **visualizer.create_visualizations()**: Creates the charts
- **fig.to_json()**: Converts Plotly figure to JSON for web browser

**Response:**
```python
return jsonify({
    'thinking': thinking,
    'answer': answer,
    'visualization': fig_json
})
```
- **Returns JSON object**: With thinking text, answer, and chart data
- **Browser JavaScript**: Will receive this data and display it

**Error handling:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```
- **except Exception**: Catches any error that occurs
- **str(e)**: Converts error object to string
- **500**: HTTP status code for internal server error

**App startup:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

## How Everything Works Together

### Step-by-Step Process Flow

1. **User opens web browser** → Navigates to `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Flask serves HTML** → Returns the complete web page with CSS and JavaScript
3. **User types query** → JavaScript captures the input text
4. **User clicks button** → JavaScript sends POST request to `/analyze`
5. **Flask receives request** → Extracts query from JSON data
6. **AI processing begins** → Calls `visualizer.get_thinking(query)`
7. **Ollama API call** → Sends prompt to local Llama3 model
8. **AI generates response** → Returns thinking process and answer
9. **Text analysis** → `parse_thinking()` breaks down the response
10. **Stage classification** → Each sentence is categorized by thinking type
11. **Visualization creation** → Charts are generated with Plotly
12. **JSON response** → Results sent back to browser
13. **Chart rendering** → Plotly.js displays interactive charts
14. **User sees results** → Thinking process, answer, and charts are shown

### Data Flow Diagram

```
User Input → JavaScript → Flask → Visualizer → Ollama → AI Model
    ↓                                                      ↓
Browser ← HTML/CSS ← JSON ← Charts ← Analysis ← Response ← Thinking
```

### Key Interactions

**Frontend-Backend Communication:**
- **Request**: JavaScript sends JSON with query
- **Response**: Flask returns JSON with thinking, answer, and visualization
- **Error Handling**: Both sides handle network and processing errors

**AI Integration:**
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts ensure structured thinking
- **Response Parsing**: Regular expressions extract thinking stages
- **Timing Simulation**: Estimated durations for visualization purposes

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
- **Text → Sentences**: Split thinking into individual thoughts
- **Sentences → Stages**: Classify each thought by type
